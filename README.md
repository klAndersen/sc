# Tutorials and code examples from learning to use scikit-learn (mostly for SVM & Text classification)

Examples and tutorials for scikit-learn. I have not made any of these, its mostly for self-learning and understanding. 
The source for each code example is linked in the files, although some of the comments are my own. Created this repository 
just to have a backup and use as a potential source reference in my Master thesis.

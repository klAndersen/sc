# Tutorials and code examples from learning to use scikit-learn (mostly for SVM & Text classification)

Examples and tutorials for scikit-learn. I have not made any of these, its mostly for self-learning and understanding. 
The source for each code example is linked in the files (some comments are my own). Created this repository just to have a backup, and be able to refer back to it in my Master thesis.
